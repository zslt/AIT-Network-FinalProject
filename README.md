# AIT-Network-FinalProject

@author: KeczerZs

This school project is an implemenation of Newman's (2004a) greedy modularity
maximatization algorithm and its improvement by Clauset, Newman and Moore (2004b).

The code of greedyQ function is also based on networkx library codes by Edward L. Platt

The test_community.py is the work of Thomas Aynaud et al. (2009)
In this project, the implementaiton of the Girvan-Newman test graph generator is used from test_community.py
